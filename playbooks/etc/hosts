# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

#green.example.com

# Ex 2: A collection of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group

[nodes]

10.0.0.240  ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=root

# If you have multiple hosts following a pattern you can specify
# them like this:

#www[001:006].example.com

# Ex 3: A collection of database servers in the 'dbservers' group

# Here's another example of host ranges, this time there are no
# leading 0s:

#db-[99:101]-node.example.com
