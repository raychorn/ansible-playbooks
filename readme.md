# About

Once upon a time, many years ago, I began working with Python and then I wanted to automate ssh interactions including everything Ansible knows how to do and much more. Believe it or not.

## Zero to Hero with Ansible.

It took me about 15ms to get ansible installed on all 4 of my computers and one of them is a Raspberry PI.  Big deal!
